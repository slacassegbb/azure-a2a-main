The application contained within is an implementation of A2A, both frontend and backend.
The overall design of the application is to be like a whatsapp group chat where agents and humans can all collaborate on unfiied problems as part of one network.

The frontend is a nextjs application, the backend is a fastAPI + websockets, and we want to create the best possible product for showing the power of A2A, human in the loop, and multi agents.

This application exposes an agent catalog that allows for dynamically adding agents to the overall workstream.
