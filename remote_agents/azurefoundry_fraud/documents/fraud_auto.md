## 2. Known Auto Fraud Schemes
- **Swoop & Squat:** Fraudster cuts off insured, slams brakes.  
- **Phantom Passenger:** Extra passengers added to claim injuries.  
- **Jump-In Claims:** Non-occupants claim to be passengers.  
- **Paper Accidents:** Reported collisions with no records.  
- **Exaggerated Injuries:** Minor crash → long-term disability claim.

## 5. Case Studies
- **Fraudulent – Staged Collision:**  
  - Four passengers claim whiplash in low-speed crash.  
  - Identical doctor notes, no ER visits.  
  - Minimal vehicle damage ($500).  
  - → Escalated to SIU, confirmed fraud.  

- **Legitimate – Intersection Accident:**  
  - Police + dashcam report consistent.  
  - Vehicle repair $8,200, medical $1,900.  
  - → Paid in full.
