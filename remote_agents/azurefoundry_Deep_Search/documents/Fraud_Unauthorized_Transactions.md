Customers should report any suspected fraud or unauthorized account activity immediately. Swift reporting helps limit losses and meet legal requirements. Key steps and policies include:
Contact the Bank Immediately: If a credit or debit card is lost, stolen, or shows unauthorized charges, notify the bank right away. Call the number on the back of your card or use the bank's online fraud reporting system

. The bank will typically lock or freeze the card to prevent further use and will issue a replacement card promptly

.
Provide Transaction Details: Be ready to give details about any unauthorized transaction (date, amount, merchant) when you report the fraud

. The bank may investigate and ask follow-up questions during the fraud claim process

.
Cardholder Liability Protection: The bank follows "zero liability" policies for fraud – meaning customers are generally not responsible for fraudulent charges. U.S. law caps consumer liability at $50 for unauthorized credit card charges, as long as you report them within 60 days of the statement date

. (Many issuers, including the bank, waive even that $50 so you pay $0 on confirmed fraud charges.) Debit card protections differ: under U.S. Electronic Fund Transfer Act rules, reporting a lost debit card within 2 business days limits your liability to $50, but waiting longer (up to 60 days) can raise the cap to $500, and beyond 60 days there may be no liability protection

. In practice, the bank aims to protect customers, but timely reporting is critical.
International and Regional Protections: The bank operates globally and complies with local regulations. For example, EU regulations (PSD2) require banks to refund unauthorized payment transactions by the next business day in most cases (unless there's evidence of customer fraud)

. Likewise, many countries' laws (and card network policies) ensure consumers are reimbursed for fraud losses as long as they promptly notify the bank.
Credit Bureau and Police Notification: It's often recommended to place a fraud alert on your credit reports by contacting one of the major credit bureaus, especially if identity theft is suspected

. In the U.S., if you report to one bureau, they notify the others. Additionally, consider filing a report with authorities: the U.S. FTC collects fraud reports, and because credit card fraud is a crime, you may choose to file a police report

. (A police report is sometimes required for certain fraud claim investigations or insurance coverage.)
Bank Investigation Process: Once fraud is reported, the bank's fraud department will investigate the transactions. The account may be frozen or the card account closed and a new card number issued (new card with a new number, security code, and expiration date)

. You will not be able to use the old card if it's found later. Monitor your accounts during this period to ensure no additional unauthorized activity occurs

. The bank may ask for a written affidavit or additional info about the fraudulent charges.
Resolution and Refunds: If the charges are confirmed as unauthorized, they are removed from your account. Legally, for credit cards the issuer must investigate and resolve billing disputes (including fraud) within two billing cycles (no more than 90 days) and cannot charge interest or fees on the disputed amount during the investigation

. The bank often provides provisional credit earlier. For debit transactions, banks typically must investigate within 10 business days; if they need longer, they must provisionally credit the disputed amount within 10 days while continuing to investigate (final resolution usually within 45 days).
Fraud Alerts and Account Monitoring: After reporting fraud, continue to monitor your account and statements. The bank provides $0 liability, so you won't have to pay fraud charges, but it's important to catch any new suspicious activity quickly

. The bank might also recommend putting a password or extra verification on your accounts after a fraud incident.
Preventive Tips: Agents should be ready to advise customers on fraud prevention. Common tips include regularly reviewing account activity, setting up account alerts for large transactions, using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, not sharing account details, and reporting lost cards immediately

. The bank's security policies may automatically block online access if login credentials appear compromised, requiring the customer to reset their password to regain access

. Remind customers never to respond to "phishing" emails or texts asking for personal info – the bank asks that suspicious emails be forwarded to spoof@bank.com and then deleted

. If a customer did respond to a scam with personal info, they should contact the bank immediately to secure their accounts
