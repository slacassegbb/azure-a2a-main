When customers inquire about opening a new account (whether a checking/savings account or another product), or what documents are needed, support agents should provide clear guidance. Additionally, agents must understand KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements and why banks ask for certain information. Key points:
Personal Information Needed: To open a bank account at the bank, a customer will need to provide proof of identity and other personal details. This typically includes: a valid government-issued photo ID (such as a driver's license, state ID, or passport), date of birth, Social Security Number (SSN) or taxpayer ID (for U.S. persons – non-U.S. citizens may provide an alternate ID like passport number and possibly visa or alien ID), and proof of address (like a utility bill or lease, if the ID does not have the current address)

. These details are needed to verify identity and comply with laws. For instance, U.S. federal law (USA PATRIOT Act Section 326) requires banks to obtain, verify, and record identification information for each person who opens an account
 – name, DOB, address, and identification number are mandatory. The bank's policies reflect that: the bank must collect the customer's birth date, residential address, and a government-issued ID number for every account holder
. If any of these are missing, the account cannot be opened.
Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML: The bank, like all financial institutions, follows strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and KYC protocols. This means additional questions may be asked at account opening, such as your occupation, employer, income, the purpose of the account, and expected types of transactions. Business accounts require even more documentation (business registration documents, information on beneficial owners who own ≥25% of the company, etc.)
. These questions are standard across the industry and are used to monitor for unusual activity and comply with regulations (e.g., to prevent money laundering or funding of illegal activities). Agents should normalize these requirements: e.g., "To open the account, I will need to gather some identification information – this is required by federal law for all banks, to protect against fraud and money laundering."
Opening the Account (Process): Customers can open accounts in several ways: online, in a branch, or over the phone (phone usually directs them to online or sets an appointment for complex products). Online account opening will walk them through entering the personal data mentioned above and uploading documents if necessary. In branch, they should bring their ID and proof of address. Typically, opening a standard checking or savings can be done the same day. The bank does not require a minimum initial deposit for basic accounts in many cases
 (though some promotions or account types might, generally it's $0 to open, but the account could be closed if it remains at $0 with no activity for 90 days
). Encourage at least a small opening deposit to get started. For accounts that do have a minimum balance or opening amount (like certain packages or time deposits), inform the customer of those dollar requirements.
Identity Verification: Sometimes, the bank might need to verify the documents provided in more detail. This could involve checking the ID's authenticity or asking follow-up questions if something doesn't match (for instance, if the credit report address differs from provided address, etc.). In some cases, additional documents may be required – for example, if someone is a non-resident alien, they might need to provide a visa or immigration documents and a secondary form of ID. If the online system cannot verify identity (maybe due to a credit report freeze or lack of data), the customer might be asked to visit a branch or submit documents. The bank may also perform a "soft pull" credit inquiry for identification purposes.
Bank Account Options: Be prepared to explain the different account packages or tiers. The bank often has account packages like Access Account, Basic, Priority, Gold, etc., each with its own features and fee waivers. For example, Access Checking is a basic account with no checkbook, suitable for those who mainly use debit and online payments
, whereas Regular Checking allows check writing. Higher tiers come with more benefits but higher balance requirements. Understanding these will help answer questions like "Which account should I choose?" based on the customer's needs.
Customer Eligibility: Generally, anyone aged 18 or older can open an account. Minors usually need a parent or guardian joint owner (e.g., a custodial or joint minor account)
. Ensure the customer is aware they must be able to provide a valid taxpayer ID – if they don't have an SSN (say, international student), they can often use a passport and another ID and might be asked for an Individual Taxpayer ID Number (ITIN) or to certify foreign status for tax purposes. U.S. citizens will need their SSN for the W-9 certification (IRS requirement).
Initial Deposit and Funding: The customer may fund the new account by transferring from an existing bank account, mailing a check, or depositing cash/check at a branch. Online, they can often provide an ACH routing/account number from another bank to pull the money. If they prefer to open now and fund later, that's usually fine, but remind them that some account types might incur a fee if they remain at $0 (depending on terms). The bank typically doesn't charge a fee just for account opening or closing (no account opening fee, and no early closure fee on basic accounts in the U.S.).
Why Banks Ask for So Much Info: Customers occasionally ask "Why do you need my SSN or job info to open a bank account?" Agents should explain it's both for identity verification and required by regulations. The Patriot Act requires banks to verify identity to help prevent funding of terrorism and money laundering
. The bank's internal policy is to collect and verify ID information and to understand the customer's financial profile to serve them better and comply with laws. All personal data is kept secure and confidential.
Account Opening for Non-U.S. Residents: The bank has a global footprint and in some locations can open accounts for non-residents. If you get inquiries from someone abroad wanting a U.S. bank account, note that the bank generally requires a U.S. address for a retail bank account (or they may direct the client to the bank's International Personal Banking unit). There are special considerations (like FATCA forms for foreign customers). These cases might be handled by specific departments.
After Opening – Next Steps: Once the account is open, the customer will receive their account number and can set up online banking (if not already done during application). A debit card will be mailed within about 5-10 business days
 (or given instantly if in-branch in some cases). Cheque books (for accounts that allow checks) can be requested. Make sure to encourage the new customer to fund the account and meet any minimum balance or activity requirements to avoid fees. For example, if the account has a monthly fee that can be waived with a $250 direct deposit each month, point that out
. The bank often has new account bonuses (like cash bonuses for depositing a certain amount); ensure the customer has any needed promo code and knows the terms if they're joining under a promotion.
