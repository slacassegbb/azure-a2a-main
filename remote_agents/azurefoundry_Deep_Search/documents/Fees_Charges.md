Customers often seek clarification on various bank fees or how to avoid them. The bank has a schedule of fees for account services, but also offers ways to waive many of them. As an agent, be transparent about fees and helpful in suggesting avoidance strategies. Key points:
Monthly Service Fees: Some bank checking accounts carry a monthly maintenance fee if certain conditions aren't met. For example, as of current terms, the Basic "Regular Checking" account has a $15 monthly fee, and the lower-tier "Access Checking" has a $5 fee
. These Monthly Service Fees are waivable – for instance, maintaining a monthly direct deposit of $250 or more will waive the fee on those accounts
. Higher-tier customers (Priority, Gold) do not incur monthly fees on their accounts
. If a customer complains about a monthly fee, review their account: do they meet waiver criteria? If not, explain how they could (perhaps by setting up their payroll direct deposit or maintaining a minimum balance)
. If they cannot meet those, perhaps suggest a different account type like Access Account (which has a lower fee and no check writing, designed for basic banking) or if they have multiple accounts, linking them for a combined balance. The bank's goal is to empower customers to avoid fees through these measures, and fee waivers are automatically applied when criteria are met.
ATM Fees: The bank doesn't charge for using bank ATMs. However, if a customer uses a non-bank ATM (out of network) in the U.S., the bank will charge a $2.50 fee per withdrawal for standard account holders
. Additionally, the ATM machine's owner may charge a surcharge (which can range $2-$5 typically). Customers in the Priority, Gold, or Private Client tiers get unlimited reimbursement of other banks' ATM fees
, and the bank itself doesn't charge them the $2.50. So effectively, premium clients have free ATM access worldwide
. If an account is charged an ATM fee, you can explain it: "Your account was charged a $2.50 Non-bank ATM usage fee, because you used an ATM outside our network. The ATM operator also charged $3, which you'll see as part of the withdrawal total – the bank doesn't keep that, it goes to the ATM owner. To avoid these fees, use our network ATMs or consider our higher-tier accounts if you frequently need out-of-network ATMs." Sometimes if a customer was truly stuck and had to use an out-of-network ATM (e.g., traveling), you may, as a courtesy, rebate a fee occasionally, but that's case-by-case and usually for good customers. Also note: simply checking balance at a foreign ATM may incur a fee by the ATM operator
, so it's best to use the mobile app for balance to avoid that.
Overdraft and NSF Fees: The bank has recently made a customer-friendly change – the bank no longer charges Overdraft Fees or Returned Item (NSF) Fees on personal banking accounts
. This is a big deal: if a customer's checking account is overdrawn, they will not see a $34 overdraft fee (unlike many banks). Instead, transactions that would overdraft may be declined (for Access Account, they're designed to just decline if not enough funds
). Regular Checking accounts have optional Overdraft Protection services like a Checking Plus® line of credit or Safety Check (link to savings)
, but even if those aren't in place, the bank has eliminated the punitive fees. If a customer asks, "I see my account went negative, am I charged?" – you can confirm that the bank has eliminated overdraft fees (since 2022)
. If a check they deposited bounced (returned unpaid from the issuer's bank), the bank likewise does not charge a traditional returned deposit fee in many cases (though the policy on that may vary; it's often waived now as part of consumer-friendly changes). Always verify current fee schedule for any changes, but as of now, the bank is among banks that dropped OD/NSF fees. This is a great point to reassure customers who are worried about an accidental overdraft.
Wire Transfer Fees: As noted earlier, outgoing wire transfers typically incur a fee. For a domestic wire, the bank's fee might be around $25 if done online (or higher if done with a teller). Incoming wires are free for retail accounts
. International outgoing wires are around $35-$45. However, the bank often waives wire fees for certain tiers or if sending in foreign currency online
. If a customer complains about a wire fee, check if they are in a tier that should have it waived. If it wasn't waived but should have, we can refund it. If they are not eligible for waiver, explain that wires are an optional service with a fee, but we do provide alternatives (ACH or Zelle) if appropriate, which are free but slower/limited.
Account Closure or Early Closure Fees: The bank generally does not charge any fee to close accounts, even if closed shortly after opening. (In earlier decades, some banks had an "early account closure fee" if closed within 90 days, but the bank doesn't apply that to standard accounts now.) We saw confirmation that closing an account costs nothing
. If a customer is worried about that, reassure them. Similarly, no fee to open an account either.
Paper Statement Fee: The bank currently does not charge a fee for paper statements for regular accounts (some banks do for basic accounts, but the bank's basic accounts as of now do not charge for paper statements – they encourage e-statements but haven't made paper cost extra for most consumer checking). Always double-check if any new fees like that are introduced.
Foreign Transaction Fees: For credit cards and debit cards used abroad, foreign exchange fees can apply. Bank credit cards – many travel cards have no foreign transaction fee, but others typically 3%. Bank debit cards have usually a 3% foreign transaction fee on non-USD transactions, plus ATM fees if out-of-network. So if a customer asks why they were charged more than the conversion rate, explain the foreign transaction fee. For example, "I see a fee of $3 on this $100 international purchase – that's the 3% foreign currency fee." If they travel often, suggest a bank product with no FX fees (like Premier or checking in certain packages).
Miscellaneous Fees: Other fees include: stop payment fee (if a customer wants to stop a check payment, there's often a fee ~$30), official bank check fee (cashier's check, maybe $10, sometimes waived for certain accounts), returned deposit item fee (though as noted, it might be zero now), copy or research fees (if they want old statements beyond what's free online, there could be a per document fee). If customers request something like a check copy or statement reprint beyond the free availability, inform them if a fee applies before proceeding. The bank's fee schedule (found in the Consumer Account Agreement disclosures) lists these. For example, a stop payment might be free for Gold but $30 for Basic accounts. Always check the client's relationship tier to see if they get freebies.
Fee Disputes: If a customer believes a fee was charged in error, investigate. Sometimes a monthly fee wasn't waived when it should have been (maybe their direct deposit didn't qualify as "Enhanced Direct Deposit" – clarify that term means usually an electronic payroll or pension deposit, not a manual transfer
). If an error, we remove the fee. If it's technically correct but the customer wasn't aware (e.g., they didn't maintain $500 balance), as a courtesy we might waive the first occurrence and educate them. The bank's philosophy is often to forgive a fee once if the customer now sets up the needed changes to avoid it future. Document any fee waiver given.
Common Fee Avoidance Tips: Agents should proactively offer advice on avoiding fees:
Maintain minimum combined balance or set up direct deposits to waive monthly fees
.
Use in-network ATMs or cashback at stores to avoid ATM fees (and if you're a frequent ATM user, consider upgrading account tier).
Opt into e-statements to have easy access to statements (no fee anyway, but saves time).
Enroll in Overdraft Protection (link to savings or a line of credit) – though the bank doesn't charge overdraft fees, linking accounts can ensure transactions are covered from savings or credit line.
Pay on time to avoid late fees or returned payment fees on credit products.
For credit cards, if they have an annual fee card and don't use benefits, maybe switch to a no-annual-fee card if they ask.
Keep an eye on the account via alerts – e.g., low balance alerts can help prevent overdrafts or declinings.
When Fees are Refunded: If we agree to refund a fee, inform the customer it will be credited to their account (usually within one business day in a deposit account, or next statement for a credit card fee credit). Apologize for any inconvenience if it was a bank error. Ensure the customer is satisfied that the issue is resolved.
Finally, always direct customers to the bank's Terms and Conditions and Fee Schedule document for a complete, updated list of fees (it's available online)
. Transparency is key – we want customers to feel informed about any costs associated with their accounts and confident that they can avoid most fees with the right account management.
