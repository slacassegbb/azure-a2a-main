Customers frequently need help with debit or credit card management – such as reporting a lost card, getting a new card, or changing their PIN. Here's what to cover:
Lost or Stolen Card – Immediate Actions: If a customer's card is lost or stolen, it's critical they report it right away. The bank will deactivate the card to prevent any unauthorized use and issue a replacement. Advise the customer to call the bank's 24/7 lost card hotline (for bank credit cards: 1-800-950-5114 in the U.S., or bank debit card line, etc.) or use the mobile app/online account which often has an option to report a card lost/stolen
. Many times, customers can also temporarily lock/freeze the card via the mobile app while they look for it
. Emphasize that acting quickly minimizes risk – federal law limits liability for unauthorized charges to $50 (and the bank's policy is $0) if promptly reported
. The bank typically honors zero liability, so the customer won't have to pay for fraudulent charges, but they need to report the loss/theft. After reporting, any attempted charges on the old card should be declined.
Replacement Card Process: The bank will send out a replacement card usually within 5-7 business days (often via regular mail, or expedited upon request possibly with a fee). The new card will have a new number and security code for security reasons
. Remind the customer to update any recurring payments or saved card info with the new card number once they receive it
. If the card was reported as lost but then found, if it's already canceled, it cannot be reactivated – they should destroy it and wait for the new one. If they had only frozen it (and then found it), they can unfreeze through the app and continue using it if no one else had access to it
.
Review for Fraudulent Charges: In the case of a stolen card, advise the customer to review recent transactions on their account. Thieves sometimes test a card with small purchases first
. If the customer spots any charge they did not do, they should report those while reporting the card theft, so the bank's fraud team can dispute/remove those charges. Typically, those charges will be credited back after investigation. If the card was merely lost and no unknown charges are present, then it's just a precautionary replacement. In any case, have them keep an eye on the account in case additional unauthorized charges appear and inform the bank immediately if so
.
PIN (Personal Identification Number) Issues: Customers might forget their card PIN or wish to change it. For forgotten PINs, the bank can mail a PIN reminder or reset letter to the customer's address on file. Some ATM networks allow PIN reset if you know your old PIN, but if it's completely forgotten, a mailed PIN is common (or in-branch reset with ID). The bank also often allows customers to change their PIN via the online account or mobile app (under card services) or at a bank ATM. As an agent, you can guide them: "To change your PIN, log in to your account online, go to Services > Credit Card/Debit Card Management > Change PIN. You will be prompted to enter a new PIN and perhaps the old one. If you have trouble, we can send you a PIN mailer." Always verify identity before discussing/changing PINs. For debit cards, branches can often instantly reset the PIN with the customer present and ID verified. Over the phone, due to security, we often can trigger a system that sends a PIN mailer (an encrypted paper with a new temporary PIN) to their registered address. Advise it takes ~5-7 days.
Card Activation: When customers receive a new or replacement card, it generally needs to be activated before use. They can activate by calling the number on the sticker (an automated system) or via their online account/app. Activation confirms that the card reached the rightful owner. If a customer has trouble activating, verify the card number and direct them accordingly.
Card Expiration and Renewal: Credit and debit cards have expiration dates (month/year). The bank automatically mails a new card before the old one expires (usually about 1-2 months prior). If a customer's card is nearing expiration and they haven't received a new one within two weeks of the last month, have them contact us – possibly their address might be outdated. If their card just expired and they are cardless, we can expedite a new card. Reassure that typically, the bank handles renewals proactively, and there is no fee for renewal. Their PIN usually remains the same for debit card renewals (unless they choose otherwise).
Damaged or Non-Working Card: If a card is worn out or the magnetic strip/chip isn't working, the customer can request a replacement card (same number). This can often be done via online account (order replacement) or through an agent. It usually comes with the same number and expiry if it's just a duplicate, but some banks issue a new number for any replacement – confirm the bank's policy. Often for damage, the number stays the same. Advise them to destroy the old card once the new one is active.
Additional Card Requests: If the inquiry is about getting an additional card (like an authorized user on a credit card account, or a spare ATM card for a joint account holder), assist with the procedure. For credit cards, the primary cardholder can request authorized user cards; they would have separate cards and numbers but on the same account. For checking accounts, each account owner can have a debit card. If, say, a customer's spouse needs a card, ensure they are a joint owner or added as one. Otherwise, they can't get a debit card on the other's account unless they make it joint.
Security Holds and Card Declines: Sometimes a customer might contact support because their card transaction was declined, possibly due to a security block (unusual spending, foreign location, etc.). Agents should check any fraud blocks. The bank might require the customer to verify some recent transactions or respond to a text alert. Once verified, the block can be lifted. Encourage customers to use the travel notice feature in their online account when traveling, to reduce unnecessary declines for foreign transactions.
Card Benefits and Services: Be ready to answer questions about the card's features, like daily ATM withdrawal limits, purchase limits, contactless payment, etc. For debit cards, standard daily withdrawal limits apply (often $500-$1000 at ATMs, and a higher limit for point-of-sale transactions). If customers need a temporary increase (for a large purchase or withdrawal), sometimes it can be arranged with a manager approval. For credit cards, if asked about credit line increases or such, guide them on how to request or whether they're eligible. These are a bit beyond basic "inquiry" but come up.
Liability and Protection for Cards: Reinforce that customers are protected if they report issues timely. The bank offers $0 liability for unauthorized transactions on both debit and credit cards as long as prompt notice is given
. The cards are also equipped with EMV chip technology and even contactless, which improves security. If a customer is concerned about someone knowing their PIN or having had access to their card, advise them to change the PIN and possibly the card number (we can replace the card).
PIN Safety: Remind customers to keep their PIN confidential and to memorize it (not write it on the card or anything). If they suspect someone else learned their PIN, they should change it. The bank will never ask for a PIN via phone or email – a good security reminder to share.
