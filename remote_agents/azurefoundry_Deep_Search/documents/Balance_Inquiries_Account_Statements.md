The bank offers multiple convenient ways for customers to check their account balances and review transactions. Agents should be knowledgeable about these methods and about how account balances are reflected. Key points:
Ways to Check an Account Balance: Customers can check their balance online via the bank's website, through the mobile app, at ATMs, by speaking to a bank teller in a branch, by phone (automated system or customer service), or by reviewing their monthly account statement

. For example, a customer with online banking can log in with their User ID and Password to see their accounts and balances. The mobile app also displays account balances once logged in, and even offers a Snapshot feature to view balances without full sign-on for quick access

. At an ATM, a bank debit or ATM card can be used with the PIN to view the checking or savings account balance on screen

. There is no fee for balance inquiries at bank ATMs, and the bank has over 65,000 fee-free ATMs in-network

. By phone, customers can call the phone banking line and, after verifying identity (account number, PIN or other security questions), they can hear their balance. And of course, monthly mailed or electronic statements show the balance as of the statement closing date.
Understanding Posted vs Available Balance: It's important to clarify the difference between an account's current (or "on deposit") balance and the available balance. The available balance is the amount currently available for withdrawal or use, which may be lower than the total balance if there are pending transactions or holds. For example, a recent check deposit may show in the account's total balance but might not yet be included in the available balance until the check clears

. Similarly, if a debit card purchase or ATM withdrawal was made, the bank may deduct the amount from the available balance immediately (authorization hold) even if the transaction hasn't fully posted to the account. Agents should explain this if customers ask "why does my available balance differ from my account balance?" Pending transactions, holds on large deposits, or debit card authorizations are common reasons

.
Account Statements: The bank provides monthly statements for checking, savings, and credit card accounts (typically delivered by mail or electronically). The statement shows the ending balance for the period, which is a snapshot as of the statement date. Remind customers that this balance may not reflect very recent transactions made after the closing date. For instance, if the statement closed on the 30th of the month, a debit purchase on the 31st won't appear until the next statement

. Statements include a detailed list of transactions (deposits, withdrawals, purchases, fees, etc.) during the period. By U.S. regulations, credit card issuers must send the billing statement at least 21 days before the payment due date

, and bank account statements for electronic transaction accounts are typically sent monthly if there were transactions (quarterly at minimum if not).
Checking Balances via ATM (Fees): Using ATMs outside of the bank's network can incur fees. The bank itself does not charge its customers for balance inquiries or withdrawals at bank ATMs. However, out-of-network ATM operators (other banks or third parties) may charge a fee for a balance inquiry or transaction. As the bank account FAQ notes, if you use an ATM outside the surcharge-free network, the ATM owner may charge a fee even just to view your balance, even if you don't complete a withdrawal

. The bank will also charge a small non-network ATM usage fee for some account types (for example, $2.50 per withdrawal for basic accounts)

. Customers in certain premium tiers (Priority, Gold, etc.) get those ATM fees reimbursed – Gold clients have unlimited reimbursement of third-party ATM fees

. As an agent, you should advise customers to use in-network ATMs or accounts with ATM fee rebates if they want to avoid extra charges for balance inquiries or withdrawals.
Frequency of Balance Checks: There is no harm in checking one's balance frequently – in fact, regular monitoring is encouraged to detect unauthorized transactions or to manage finances. Some customers like to check daily or weekly. Online and mobile banking make this easy. You can reassure users that checking their balance online or at an ATM frequently will not affect their account (it's a non-intrusive inquiry).
Troubleshooting Balance Discrepancies: If a customer feels their balance is wrong (e.g., a deposit is missing or a charge is incorrect), the agent should assist in reviewing the transaction history. Sometimes the issue is timing (a check is on hold or a debit card charge is pending). If there truly is an error, it may require filing a dispute or error claim. Under regulations, banks must investigate errors; for instance, in the U.S., an electronic transaction error reported promptly must be investigated and corrected if confirmed. See the Fraud section for unauthorized charges – those should be addressed immediately. For deposit errors (like an ATM deposit not credited), internal escalation to the bank's operations team would be needed.
