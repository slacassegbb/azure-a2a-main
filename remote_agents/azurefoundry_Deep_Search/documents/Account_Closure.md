When customers decide to close their account, either due to moving banks or other reasons, the bank makes the process straightforward. As an agent, you should assist them professionally and ensure any loose ends are tied up. Key points to handle:
Steps to Close an Account: The bank offers a few convenient options for closing an account. The customer can request account closure online via secure chat on the bank website (by signing in and going to the customer service/chat section)
. They can also call bank customer service (e.g., for U.S. accounts, 1-800-374-9700) and after verifying identity, inform the representative they want to close the account
. Lastly, the customer can visit a bank branch in person to close the account with a banker or teller
. No matter the method, the bank will typically ask for a reason (for internal records) and then process the closure. It's often quickest via phone or online chat, as mailing a written closure request would be a slower "snail mail" option
.
Before Closing – Check for Pending Items: Agents should always review the account before closing. Ensure the account has a $0 balance (or very small balance). If there is money in the account, the customer can withdraw it or we can transfer it to another account or mail them a check for the remaining balance upon closure. Similarly, check for any pending transactions – if there are authorizations or checks outstanding, it's wise to wait for those to clear to avoid complications. Advise the customer to cancel any automatic payments or direct deposits that go into or out of this account. For example, if their paycheck is deposited to this account, they should give their employer new bank details before closing. Or if they have utility bills auto-debited, update those with a new account. This prevents payments from being missed or the closed account being inadvertently reopened. A helpful tip: have them review a recent statement to catch any recurring transactions they need to move

. The bank's rep will usually ask "Are all your checks cleared and direct deposits moved?" as part of the closure process.
Fees and Charges: The bank does not charge a fee to close accounts

. If a customer asks "how much does it cost to close my account," you can reassure them there's no fee. In fact, if they're maintaining the account just to avoid a fee (like a monthly fee), it might save them money to close if they no longer need it. Also clarify that if the account has a negative balance or owed fees, those must be paid before closure. If the account is overdrawn, the customer should deposit enough to bring it to zero. If the account had a promotion with an early closure penalty (rare for checking; more common for say a CD), inform them if applicable (e.g., closing a CD early might incur a penalty). But for standard deposit accounts, no closure penalty.
Impact on Credit Score: Closing a bank deposit account generally does not affect credit scores (unlike closing a credit card, which can potentially impact credit). The exception is if the account was closed with money owed – e.g., an overdraft that wasn't repaid, which could get sent to collections. So as long as the account is closed in good standing (no debt), it will not show up on a credit report or impact credit

. If customers are concerned, emphasize that checking/savings accounts aren't part of credit history. However, note that if they have a linked line of credit or overdraft line, closing those could appear as a closed credit account on their report.
Confirmation and Timeline: Once the closure is processed, the bank will provide a confirmation number or letter. The account typically closes immediately if everything is settled, but it might remain in a terminating status for a short period (a day or two) to ensure no straggling transactions. Any scheduled bill payments or transfers will be canceled when the account closes. If the customer is expecting any final interest (for interest-bearing accounts), the bank will usually credit it up to the closure date. Advise the customer to destroy any remaining checks or debit cards associated with the account after closure (to prevent any misuse). They should also update any online accounts where that bank info was saved.
Encourage Feedback (Optional): If appropriate, you might ask if there was anything the bank could have done better or if they're willing to share a reason for closing – sometimes this feedback helps the bank improve. Customers might be leaving due to moving to an area without branches, better rates elsewhere, or dissatisfaction. This is optional and depends on the context; the primary goal is a smooth closure.
Retention Attempts: The bank does value its customers, so in some cases, there may be retention offers (such as waiving fees, offering a different account type) if the customer is open to it. Use judgment based on the situation. If a customer is truly set on closing, do not pressure them, but if they mention a specific issue (like "the fees are too high"), you could mention alternatives ("We do have a no-monthly-fee account if that's the only issue, would you be interested?"). However, if they are moving out of country or already decided, simply proceed with the closure professionally.
After Closure – Other Products: Ensure the customer doesn't mistakenly also cancel other bank products they wanted to keep. For instance, sometimes customers say "close my account" but they meant only the checking account, not their credit card or other relationship. Verify exactly which account or accounts they want to close. Each account will need a separate closure request. If they have a package (checking and savings linked), clarify if both are to be closed.
Return of Deposits or Checks: If the customer had any pre-written checks that have not been presented yet, advise them that those will be returned unpaid after closure ("account closed" return reason). It's best if they can contact the payees of any outstanding checks to arrange alternative payment to avoid bounced checks. Similarly, any direct deposits coming in after closure will typically be rejected.
Policy on Reopening: The bank's policy on reopening closed accounts can vary. Often, once fully closed, an account cannot be reopened; the customer would need to open a new account. If a customer changes their mind shortly after closing, they might have a window (a few days) to stop the closure if they contact us immediately, but no guarantee. It's good to mention in passing, "Once I process this, the account will be permanently closed. Are you sure you'd like to proceed?" to avoid any misunderstanding.
