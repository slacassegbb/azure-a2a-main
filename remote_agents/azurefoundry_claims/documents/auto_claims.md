## 2. Settlement Rules

- **Total Loss Threshold (TLT):** 75% of ACV.  
- **Depreciation:** 1.5% per month since in-service date; never below 20% of MSRP.  
- **Betterment:** If new parts significantly improve value (e.g., new tires >6/32”), apply partial deduction.  
- **Glass Repairs:** Deductible waived if repairable; deductible applies if full replacement.  
- **Rental Coverage:** Ends when repair complete or 3 days after total loss offer.

## 3. Documentation by Scenario

- **Collision:** Police/incident report, photos, repair estimate, odometer reading.  
- **Theft:** Police report, list of keys, last known location/time, anti-theft proof.  
- **Comprehensive (hail/fire):** Weather report, photos, repair estimates.  
- **Total Loss:** Vehicle title, lienholder details, salvage retention preference.

## 5. Example Settlements

### Collision – Not Total Loss
- ACV: $18,000  
- Repair Estimate: $6,200  
- Deductible: $1,000  
→ Net repair = $5,200  
→ Rental reimbursed up to 30 days × $50/day.  

### Comprehensive – Windshield Repair
- Shop confirms repairable chip.  
- Deductible waived.  
- Insurer pays full repair cost ($350).  

### Total Loss with Salvage
- ACV: $14,500  
- Deductible: $1,000  
- Salvage retained by insured (value $1,800)  
→ Payout = $14,500 − $1,000 − $1,800 = $11,700.

## 6. Special Scenarios

- **Stolen Vehicle Recovered:** If recovered within 30 days and repairable → treat as comp loss. If already settled as total loss → insurer takes salvage.  
- **New Vehicle Replacement:** If policy includes endorsement and vehicle < 12 months old → replace with new equivalent model instead of ACV.  
- **Rental Beyond Limit:** Not reimbursable; customer responsible for additional cost.
