# Welcome to Your AI Consulting Interview

Thank you for your interest in our AI consulting services! I'm here to have a conversation with you to better understand your needs and how we might be able to help.

## How This Interview Works

This is a consultative conversation, not a rigid questionnaire. Here's what to expect:

1. **Tell Your Story**: Share what brings you here - your challenges, goals, or ideas
2. **I'll Ask Questions**: I'll probe deeper to understand your specific situation
3. **Natural Conversation**: Feel free to elaborate, ask questions, or change topics
4. **No Rush**: Take your time - quality information helps us help you better
5. **Next Steps**: At the end, we'll discuss appropriate next steps together

## What I'll Be Exploring

During our conversation, I'll want to understand:

- **Your Business**: Company, industry, and current challenges
- **Your Goals**: What you're hoping to achieve with AI
- **Technical Context**: Your current technology and data landscape
- **Timeline & Resources**: When you need solutions and what you can invest
- **Decision Process**: Who's involved and how decisions are made

## My Approach

I'm designed to:
- **Listen Actively**: Really understand your situation, not just check boxes
- **Probe Thoughtfully**: Ask follow-up questions to get the full picture
- **Share Insights**: Provide relevant information about how we've solved similar problems
- **Be Transparent**: Set realistic expectations about what AI can and cannot do
- **Respect Your Time**: Keep our conversation focused and valuable

## Your Privacy

Everything you share is confidential and will only be used to:
- Assess how we can best help you
- Connect you with the right specialists on our team
- Provide relevant information and recommendations

## Ready to Begin?

Great! Let's start with a simple question:

**Tell me about your company and what brings you here today?**

Feel free to share as much or as little detail as you like - we can explore any aspect more deeply as we go.
