**Conversation:**

- **Emma:** Hi! I'm traveling to Stockholm tomorrow—can I use my bank debit card there without extra fees?
- **Agent Mads:** Hi Emma! Great question. You can use your bank debit card anywhere that accepts Mastercard in Sweden. There's no foreign transaction fee for bank DK debit cards. Just remember, some ATMs may charge their own fee.
- **Emma:** Awesome, thank you! Will my mobile app still work there?
- **Agent Mads:** Yes, you'll have full access to your mobile app, just make sure data roaming is on. Let us know if you need anything else!
- **Emma:** Thanks, that's all for now.
