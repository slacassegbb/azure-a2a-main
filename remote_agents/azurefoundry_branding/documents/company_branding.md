## 🎨 Color Framework (Conceptual)

The Company brand palette is built around **trustworthy neutrals** and **intelligent highlights**.  
Avoid hard-coding color hex values — instead use these *conceptual descriptors* in prompts.

| **Primary Accent** | Intelligent blue, deep navy | Subtle highlights, technology cues |
| **Secondary Accent** | Warm amber, coral undertone | Energy, human warmth, small emphasis |
| **Support Tones** | Mist silver, matte graphite | Depth, structure, framing |
| **Natural Neutrals** | Off-white, beige, light taupe | Balance and softness |

> _Rule:_ All images should evoke **clarity, balance, and intelligence** — not vibrancy for its own sake.
